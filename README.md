# ML-Projects
## Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my repository of Machine Learning projects! This collection includes a variety of projects where I apply machine learning algorithms and techniques to solve real-world problems. From classification and regression models to deep learning, you’ll find a range of examples demonstrating my understanding and application of ML concepts.

## Projects Overview
This repository contains machine learning projects focusing on the following areas:

 - Supervised Learning: Classification and regression tasks with algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, etc.
   
 - Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and dimensionality reduction with techniques like K-Means, PCA, etc.
   
 - Deep Learning: Neural networks and models using frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
   
 - Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text classification, sentiment analysis, and text generation.
   
 - Time Series Forecasting: Analyzing and predicting sequential data.
